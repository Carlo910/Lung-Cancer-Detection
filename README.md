# Lung-Cancer-Detection
This project was undertaken as a component of the Neuroengineering course in the final year of my Masterâ€™s program.

Details about the project's objectives and framework are available in the "Docs" folder.

The "FinalModel" document holds the definitive version of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that was presented upon the project's completion.
